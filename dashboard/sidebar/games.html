        <p>With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, you may have become more conscious about the air you breathe and the surfaces you touch. Disease transmission can happen in different ways, but the most unpredictable method is via airborne transmission.</p>
         <p>There are very few diseases that can be transmitted through the air. Airborne diseases linger in dust particles and respiratory droplets, which are eventually inhaled by other people. In fact, you donâ€™t need to be in the same room as a sick person to contract an airborne disease. </p>
                        <h3>How Airborne Transmission Works</h3>
            <p>Airborne diseases are bacteria or viruses that are most commonly transmitted through small respiratory droplets. These droplets are expelled when someone with the airborne disease sneezes, coughs, laughs, or otherwise exhales in some way. These infectious vehicles can travel along air currents, linger in the air, or cling to surfaces, where they are eventually inhaled by someone else. </p>

               <p>Airborne transmission can occur over relatively long distances and spans of time. If you go into the bathroom that someone coughed in minutes before, it could be a danger. This makes it possible for airborne diseases to infect larger numbers of people and more difficult to determine the causes due to a lack of person-to-person contact. </p>

                  <p> Airborne transmission has varying capabilities. Airborne diseases can travel distances greater than 6 feet and remain infectious in the air from minutes to hours. This largely depends on the type of ventilation and preventative measures inside the building. </p>

                  Tuberculosis (TB)
      <h2>Tuberculosis, or TB,</h2> is a bacterial disease of the lungs and throat. When a person with TB coughs, speaks, or laughs, the TB bacteria are released into the air. TB is not transmitted through touching, kissing, or sharing food.  

      <h3>Symptoms of TB.</h3> Symptoms vary depending on where the bacteria have settled in your body. Common symptoms include:
      <ul>
         <li>A bad cough lasting longer than 3 weeks</li> 
         <li>Chest pain</li> 
         <li>Coughing up blood or phlegm</li> 
         <li>Fatigue</li> 
         <li>Weight loss</li> 
         <li>Loss of appetite</li> 
         <li>Chills</li> 
         <li>Fever</li> 
         <li>Night sweats </li> 
      </ul>
         <p>Someone can be infected with TB bacteria but not develop TB disease until years later. This is typically dependent on their immune system. People who have recently been infected with TB bacteria and people with weakened immune systems are at a greater risk for developing TB disease.</p>
